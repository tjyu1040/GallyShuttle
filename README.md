### Building backend module

The backend is built using Google App Engine. Follow the instructions provided in the following links:

1. [Debugging the backend locally] (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gradle-appengine-templates/tree/master/GcmEndpoints#11-debugging-the-backend-locally)
2. [Obtaining Google Cloud Messaging API key] (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gradle-appengine-templates/tree/master/GcmEndpoints#21-obtaining-google-cloud-messaging-api-key)
3. [Deploying the backend live to App Engine] (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gradle-appengine-templates/tree/master/GcmEndpoints#25-deploying-the-backend-live-to-app-engine)

### Building mobile and wear modules

The mobile app uses Fabric for crash reporting, Google Analytics for analytics, and Google Cloud
Messaging for notifications, which will need to be configured.

#### Fabric Setup

1. Sign up at [fabric.io](https://get.fabric.io/).
2. Install Fabric IDE plugin.
3. Rename `mobile/fabric.properties.sample` to `mobile/fabric.properties`.
4. Fill in your API key and secret in `mobile/fabric.properties`.

#### Google Analytics, App Invites, & Google Cloud Messaging Setup

1. Go to this link: [Enable Google services for your app](https://developers.google.com/mobile/add?platform=android)
2. Create a new project for your own app.
3. Add "Analytics", "App Invites", & "Cloud Messaging" services and generate your configuration file.
4. Download `google-services.json` and move it to `mobile/` directory.

##### Integrating Google Analytics & Google Cloud Messaging

This section is still under construction, as Google Analytics and Google Cloud Messaging has not been 
fully integrated and tested yet.
