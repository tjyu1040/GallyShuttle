                <h1>Terms of Services</h1>

                <p>
                    These terms of service ("Terms") apply to your access and use of Gally Shuttle
                    (the "Service"). Please read them carefully.
                </p>

                <h3>Accepting These Terms</h3>

                <p>
                    If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all of the
                    terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read all of the terms. If
                    you don't agree to all of the terms below, please do not use the Service. Also,
                    if a term does not make sense to you, please let us know by e-mailing
                    <a href="mailto:ephemeral.dreams.mobile@gmail.com?Subject=GallyShuttle%20Term%20of%20Services%20Inquiry"
                       target="_top">ephemeral.dreams.mobile@gmail.com</a>
                </p>

                <h3>Changes to These Terms</h3>

                <p>
                    We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance, we may
                    need
                    to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature or for some other
                    reason.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective 1 day after
                    we post such revised Terms (indicated by revising the date at the top of these
                    Terms) or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate
                    acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or
                    acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check Gally Shuttle for changes
                    to these Terms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, then
                    you have accepted the changes to these Terms.
                </p>

                <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
